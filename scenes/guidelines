This is how a .2d file should look:

WINDOW <double> <double> <double> <double>      # This is what will be effectively draw in the window
VIEWPORT <int> <int>							# This will be our window size in pixels

TRANSFORM <double x9>							# Scene transformation. This is applied to all objects in scene,
												# after the object transformations

ELEMENTCOUNT <int>								# Number of elements we'll describe below

_SHAPE_ <shape data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>
_PAINT_ <paint data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>

_SHAPE_ <shape data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>
_PAINT_ <paint data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>

...


_SHAPE_ can be:

	TRIANGLE : <double x6>, which are coodinates of the vertice v0, v1, v2

_PAINT_ can be:
	
	SOLID : <unsigned char x4>, which are R G B A color channels

	LINEAR : <spread> <p0> <p1> <s0> <rgba> <s1> <rgba> <s2> <rgba> ...
			where <spread> is the type of spreading to the gradient (pad, repeat, reflect,...),
			<p0> and <p1> are the starting and ending points for the gradient and each pair <si> <rgba>
			is a stop point and its respective color. <si> is in the range [0, 1].

	RADIAL: <spread> <center> <focus> <radius> <s0> <rgba> <s1> <rgba> ...
			where <spread> defines how we'll spread/wrap the gradient (pad, repeat, reflect, ...),
			<center> and <focus> are points and and each pair <si> <rgba> is a stop point and its
			respective color.
