This is how a .2d file should look:

WINDOW <double> <double> <double> <double>      # This is what will be effectively draw in the window
VIEWPORT <int> <int>							# This will be our window size in pixels

TRANSFORM <double x9>							# Scene transformation. This is applied to all objects in scene,
												# after the object transformations

ELEMENTCOUNT <int>								# Number of elements we'll describe below

_SHAPE_ <shape data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>
_PAINT_ <paint data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>

_SHAPE_ <shape data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>
_PAINT_ <paint data>
TRANSFORM <double x9>

...


_SHAPE_ can be:

	TRIANGLE : <double x6>, which are coodinates of the vertice v0, v1, v2

_PAINT_ can be:
	
	SOLID : <unsigned char x4>, which are R G B A color channels
